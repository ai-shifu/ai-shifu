These AI courses provide learners with highly personalized teaching, similar to one-on-one tutoring.\n- The content-creation workflow on the AI-Shifu platform operates as follows:\n  - The instructor creates prompts **for the AI model**, essentially writing a “teaching guide” for the AI.\n  - The AI then generates the final content delivered to the learners.",

The user’s familiarity with prompts is {{prompt_understanding}}. Based on this, explain the content-creation logic of AI-Shifu according to their actual experience level.\n\n2. ===![AI-Shifu creation.png](https://resource.ai-shifu.cn/37328c5cd8494677a4677c1c731ccf5f)===\n\n\n3. Emphasize:\n!===  \nSo the **core of content creation in AI-Shifu** is:\n    - You create *for the AI*, writing a “teaching guide” for the AI  \n    - The AI then completes the final teaching experience delivered to the learner  \n!===\n\n---\n\n!===\nNext, here’s a small exercise.\nOn the AI-Shifu platform, if you want to teach learners “What is AI?”, how would you write this “teaching guide”?\n!===\n\n?[%{{ai_intro_requirement}}...Please enter your answer]\n\nYou have given the user a question requiring them to write a prompt for the AI.\nYou need to judge whether their input is correct and provide feedback.\n\nUser input:\n- {{ai_intro_requirement}}\n\nJudgment rules:\nBelow are three criteria. If the user meets any two, the answer is considered correct:\n1. Tells the AI what action to perform, including a clear verb (e.g., introduce, summarize, translate, generate, explain).\n2. Tells the AI what the target object is (e.g., “introduce what AI is”—the object is AI).\n3. Tells the AI output requirements, specifying format, length, style, or audience (e.g., within 100 words, understandable for children, output in list format).\n\nFeedback rules:\n- If the answer is incorrect, explain the reason and provide suggestions for improvement.\n\n?[Continue learning]\n\n!=== \n## How to Produce Deterministic Output \n!===\nExplain the following to the user:\n1. First, describe when deterministic output is needed (i.e., when the AI should not improvise), such as:\n  - Objective factual data  \n  - Signature quotes with fixed wording  \n!===\n2. There are two ways to write deterministic content:\n  - For a single-line deterministic segment: use ```===deterministic content===```\n  - For multi-line deterministic content: use a separate ```!===``` as the start and end fence (each on its own line)\n\nIf you want the AI to output classic lines from the movie Forrest Gump, you can write:\n```\nForrest Gump classic quotes:\n!===\nLife is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you’re gonna get.\n!===\n```\nOr:\n```\nJenny classic quote: ===Run, Forrest, run ===\n!===\n```\n---\nBased on the user’s background {{sys_user_background}}, give the user a scenario requiring them to write a one-sentence line using AI-Shifu’s deterministic-output format.\nOnly tell them which sentence to output, do not give extra explanation.\nAllow the user to answer freely.\n\n?[%{{deterministic_output_answer}}...Please enter your answer]\n\nNow judge the user’s answer: {{deterministic_output_answer}}\n\nThe answer is considered correct if it meets either of the following:\n- The input includes two ```===``` markers, with content between them.\n- The input includes two ```!===``` markers, each standing alone on its own line, with content between them.\n\nNotes:\n1. If the user includes only one ```===``` or ```!===```, the answer is incorrect.\n2. You only need to give the evaluation result — no need to ask the user to resubmit.\n\n?[ Review this lesson ]\n\n- Praise and encourage the user for completing today’s learning tasks.\n- !===\n\n#  Let’s Review\nThis lesson covered two key parts:\n1. The essence of content creation on AI-Shifu is writing prompts *for the AI*, and the AI delivers the final learning content.\n2. When deterministic output is required, place the fixed content between ```!===``` or ```===``` markers.\n!==="

      "content": "=== # How AI-Shifu Allows Your Course to Include Images and Videos ===\nStart with an introduction explaining that in modern teaching content, beyond text, images, and videos are becoming increasingly important.\n\nNote:\n- Do NOT mention how AI-Shifu technically supports images or videos in the opening.\n\n=== So you might be wondering: how can we make AI-Shifu insert images and videos into its output? ===\n\n---\n\n!===\n\n## How to Insert Images in AI-Shifu’s Output\n\nTo insert images into AI-Shifu’s output, the key is allowing AI-Shifu to return the image’s accessible URL.  \nThe simplest way is to insert images directly in the editor’s visual creation view:\n\n1. In the creation area, type `/` to open the menu where you can insert an image  \n<img src=\"https://resource.ai-shifu.cn/7e679f6abf614f528c1f7c94bb5b28a3\" alt=\"add picture1.png\" title=\"add picture1.png\" width=\"50%\" />\n\n2. Select the image you want to import  \n<img src=\"https://resource.ai-shifu.cn/31a949462fd8462293f064db1c4dc874\" alt=\"add picture 2.png\" title=\"add picture 2.png\" width=\"50%\" />\n\n**Note**:\n- Normally, the inserted image information needs to be placed inside the deterministic-output markers ```!===```.  \n  Because AI-Shifu’s written content is designed for the AI to read, you must ensure the AI outputs the exact image information.  \n  For example:\n```\n!===\nimage information\n!===\n```\n\n!===\n\n?[Continue]\n\n!===\n\n## How to Insert Videos in AI-Shifu’s Output\n\nAI-Shifu currently supports inserting video links from **Bilibili** and **YouTube**.  \nUsing YouTube as an example:\n\n1. Copy the link of the video you want to insert  \n<img src=\"https://resource.ai-shifu.cn/39b88e942c9e4fb2bad1eac66413222a\" alt=\"youtube link.png\" title=\"youtube link.png\" width=\"50%\" />\n\n2. In the creation area, type `/` to open the menu where you can insert a video  \n<img src=\"https://resource.ai-shifu.cn/f1a57799649a493aab53406ce0d1746c\" alt=\"add video 1.png\" title=\"add video 1.png\" width=\"50%\" />\n\n3. Paste the video URL  \n<img src=\"https://resource.ai-shifu.cn/953f20df79bf4506a4a7846902c3216b\" alt=\"add video 2.png\" title=\"add video 2.png\" width=\"50%\" />\n\n**Note**:\n- Normally, video information also needs to be placed inside deterministic-output markers ```!===```.  \n  Since the content is for the AI to read, you must ensure the AI deterministically outputs the video information.  \n  For example:\n\n```  \n!===\nvideo information\n!===\n```\n\n!===\n\n?[Review this lesson]\n\n- First, praise and encourage the user for today’s learning.\n- Then output the following:\n\n!=== \n# Review\nThis lesson covered:\n1. To insert images or videos into the content generated by AI-Shifu, type “/” in the editor’s visual view and use the quick actions to add them instantly.\n2. **Important**: Image and video information must be placed inside deterministic-output markers `!===` to ensure the AI outputs them correctly.\n\n**Additional Notes:**  \nAI-Shifu displays output in Markdown format.  \nYou can directly use Markdown to produce images, tables, and many other document formats.  \nFor detailed Markdown guidance, see: [markdownguide](https://www.markdownguide.org)\n!==="
