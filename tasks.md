- [x] For each task below, finish the change in isolation, run `pre-commit run -a`, and create an atomic commit before moving on.
- [x] Remove the deprecated `src/web/` workspace (delete the directory tree and any web-only assets that live alongside it).
- [x] Update repository tooling to drop `src/web` assumptions, including pruning hooks from `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and removing the scan target from `scripts/update_i18n.py`.
- [x] Capture an audit that compares HTTP usage between `src/web` and `src/cook-web` (including `src/cook-web/src/c-api`) so the backend removal scope is explicit; commit the findings under `docs/` for traceability.
- [x] Retire the unused `/api/course/get-course-info` route by deleting its handler and removing the course blueprint registration while keeping shared service helpers intact.
- [x] Retire the unused study routes `/api/study/get_lesson_tree` and `/api/study/reset-study-progress`, ensuring supporting services/tests continue to cover active flows.
- [x] Clean the Docker Compose stacks (`docker/docker-compose.yml`, `docker/docker-compose.prod.yml`, `docker/docker-compose.dev.yml`) to drop the `ai-shifu-web` service and adjust dependencies/volumes appropriately.
- [x] Update Docker build and proxy assets (`docker/dev_in_docker.sh`, `docker/nginx.conf`, `docker/nginx.dev.conf`) to eliminate `ai-shifu-web` references and serve Cook Web correctly.
- [x] Simplify `.github/workflows/build-on-release.yml` by removing the `build-web` matrix entry and associated image variables so CI only builds API and Cook Web artifacts.
- [x] Scrub duplicated agent guides (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`) to remove `src/web` instructions and explain Cook Web as the consolidated frontend.
- [x] Refresh onboarding and licensing docs (`INSTALL_MANUAL.md`, `LICENSE.txt`) so the two-component architecture is accurate and no `src/web` paths remain.
- [x] Update README materials (`README.md`, `README_ZH-CN.md`) to reflect the new Docker access pattern and emphasize Cook Web as the sole web surface.
- [x] After code and docs are updated, run `rg 'src/web' --glob '!**/node_modules/**'` to confirm no stale references remain and address any matches.
- [x] Execute project verification (backend `pytest`, Cook Web lint/build, `docker compose config`) and record the outcomes for reviewer reference.
- [x] Audit `src/cook-web/src/c-api/**` and migrate or delete legacy helpers so only actively used endpoints remain (e.g., drop unused `/api/user/register`, `/api/user/login`, `/api/user/reset_password`, `/api/user/require_reset_code`, `/api/user/update_password`, `/api/user/generate_chk_code`, `/api/order/order-test` helpers) before touching the backend.
- [x] Remove the matching legacy user/order routes from `src/api/flaskr/route/user.py` and `src/api/flaskr/route/order.py`, along with the supporting service functions, DTOs, and tests that become dead code.
- [ ] Prune auxiliary references left after the removals (e.g., `by_pass_login_func` entries, unused repository helpers, stale i18n keys) and ensure `docs/endpoint-audit.md` reflects the final public surface.
- [ ] Re-run end-to-end verification (`pytest`, Cook Web lint/build, `docker compose config`) once the API cleanup is complete and capture the results for reviewers.
